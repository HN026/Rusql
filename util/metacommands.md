# Meta Commands

Meta commands are commands that are used to interact with the RUSQL shell itself, rather than the SQL database. Here are the currently supported meta commands:

## Usage

### .help
The `.help` command displays a list of all available commands and their descriptions. It's a quick reference guide to help you understand and use the RUSQL shell more effectively
```bash
RUSQL>> .help
```

### .cls
The `.cls` command is used to clear the RUSQL shell screen. This is useful for decluttering the console and making room for new commands and their output.
```bash
RUSQL>> .cls
```

### .exit

The `.exit` command is used to exit the RUSQL shell.
```bash
RUSQL>> .exit
```
